# UnityWayFinder
Creating Tafe Way Finding application using Unity

The purpose of this application is to be deployable on multiple platforms (Windows + Android) and allow indoor navigation using floor plans of North Metropolitan Tafe Campuses.

The UI is simple and allows a user to select a starting location, and an end location, then the app overlays a direction line over the top of the map.
